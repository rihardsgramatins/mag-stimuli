# Master Thesis Stimuli Generation

This project aims to generate stimuli for a master thesis experiment. The stimuli consist of matrices with various configurations based on different grouping principles.

## Description

The project includes Python scripts to generate stimuli matrices with the following grouping principles:
- No Grouping
- Similarity
- Common Ground
- Proximity
- All Grouping

Each grouping principle generates matrices with different visual arrangements of elements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rihardsgramatins/mag-stimuli.git
```

2. Run the Python script to generate stimuli matrices in assets folder:
    
```python
